## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
var UName = "Taghrid" // the app used by many useres so the name is var
var UAge: Int;"27" // the age is var debend on diffrent user's age
var StepsCount = "3000" // this is the counter of steps during the dya which increas by time so its var
let GoalNumber = "5000" // this is set goal of the user want to reach every day so its let(constant) but** as user I can change my goal later so if the app has this featuer I may use var to set my goal again then it will be let or maybe I declare changmygoal to var
var AverageHR = "110" // Heart rates are varity from day to day and user to other so its variable. 
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
